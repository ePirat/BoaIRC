The BoaIRC Docs
==================

BoaIRC is a simple, threaded IRC library written in Python, which is based on a simple handler
registration principle.

You can register various methods that handle specific IRC command (or numeric codes) and in this way
use it to build a full-featured IRC bot or whatever else you need. BoaIRC will not limit you in any way
and gives you full control.
